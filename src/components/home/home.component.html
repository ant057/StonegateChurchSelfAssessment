                        <p class="mat-subheading-1">Paul Tripp summarizes the universal human problem
                            by saying, “Our self-perception is as
                            accurate as a carnival mirror.” It is so easy to think one thing about ourself, while
                            the
                            opposite is
                            actually true. Simply put, all of us have a need to grow in self-awareness. To state it
                            even
                            more
                            strongly,
                            there are few things as important as adequate self-awareness in a person’s life,
                            especially
                            if you are a
                            leader of people.
                            We want to serve you by urging you to consider the questions in the following
                            exercise. <br> The goal of this exercise is simple, we want this leader to see (with more
                            accuracy) who
                            they are and
                            who
                            they are not, and then (by the grace of God) be content with who it is that God has made
                            them to be.
                            With
                            your help, this person can gain more insight into who they are through someone other
                            than
                            themselves. We
                            consider this a mercy from God and a beautiful picture of what it means to be known.
