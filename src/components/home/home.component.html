                The Goal of This Exercise
            </div>
            <p class="mat-subheading-1 align-center">Paul Tripp summarizes the universal human problem
                by saying, “Our self-perception is as
                accurate as a carnival mirror.” It is so easy to think one thing about ourself, while
                the
                opposite is
                actually true. Simply put, all of us have a need to grow in self-awareness. To state it
                even
                more
                strongly,
                there are few things as important as adequate self-awareness in a person’s life,
                especially
                if you are a
                leader of people.
                We want to serve you by urging you to consider the questions in the following
                exercise. <br> The goal of this exercise is simple, we want this leader to see (with more
                accuracy) who
                they are and
                who
                they are not, and then (by the grace of God) be content with who it is that God has made
                them to be.
                With
                your help, this person can gain more insight into who they are through someone other
                than
                themselves. We
                consider this a mercy from God and a beautiful picture of what it means to be known.<br><br>
