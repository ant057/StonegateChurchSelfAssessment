    <h3>The Goal of This Exercise</h3>
    <p class="mat-body">Paul Tripp summarizes the universal human problem by saying, “Our self-perception is as
        accurate as a carnival mirror.” It is so easy to think one thing about ourself, while the opposite is
        actually true. Simply put, all of us have a need to grow in self-awareness. To state it even more strongly,
        there are few things as important as adequate self-awareness in a person’s life, especially if you are a
        leader of people. We want to serve you by urging you to consider the questions in the following exercise.
        The goal of this exercise is simple, we want this leader to see (with more accuracy) who they are and who
        they are not, and then (by the grace of God) be content with who it is that God has made them to be. With
        your help, this person can gain more insight into who they are through someone other than themselves. We
        consider this a mercy from God and a beautiful picture of what it means to be known. </p>
